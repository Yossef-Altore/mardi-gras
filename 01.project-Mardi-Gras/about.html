                <h1>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h1>
                <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                    Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before
                    Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major
                    parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most
                    elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many
                    events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some
                    of them masquerade balls).</p>
                <p>The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                    schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                    earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well
                    known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for
                    naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for
                    naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly
                    African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common
                    throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies,
                    and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.</p>
                <p>While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades
                    originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal
                    Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux
                    and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the
                    weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the
                    Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>he first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River
                    in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and
                    their men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first
                    celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot
                    celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A
                    Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already
                    established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were
                    sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or
                    enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of
                    French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New
                    Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                    frolic, and comic
                    masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and
                    boys, women and
                    girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in
                    grotesque, quizzical,
                    diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and
                    birds, beasts and birds
                    with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats
                    from the moon;
                    mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons,
                    carts, coaches, cars,
                    &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming,
                    fiddling, fifeing, and
                    all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.
                </p>
                <p>In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                    observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the
                    Mystick Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its
                    celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a
                    clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to
                    Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a
                    certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting
                    of how their business prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional.
                    The lead in organized Carnival passed from Creole to American just as political and economic power
                    did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with
                    Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets,
                    represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."

                <h1>Effects of Hurricane Katrina</h1>
                <p>The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 caused a few people to question the
                    future of the city's Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006,
                    tried to play this sentiment for electoral advantage. However, the economics of
                    Carnival were, and are, too important to the city's revival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back
                    celebration to limit strains on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and
                    would be ready to parade, so negotiations between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a
                    compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less severely than originally suggested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through
                    Marigny and the French Quarter on February 11, the Saturday two weekends before Mardi Gras. There
                    were several parades on Saturday, February 18, and Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras. Parades
                    followed daily from Thursday night through Mardi Gras. Other than Krewe du Vieux and two Westbank
                    parades going through Algiers, all New Orleans parades were restricted to the Saint Charles Avenue
                    Uptown to Canal Street route, a section of the city which escaped significant flooding. Some krewes
                    unsuccessfully pushed to parade on their traditional Mid-City route, despite the severe flood damage
                    suffered by that neighborhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city restricted how long parades could be on the street and how late at night they could end.
                    National Guard troops assisted with crowd control for the first time since 1979. Louisiana State
                    troopers also assisted, as they have many times in the past. Many floats had been partially
                    submerged in floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes repaired and removed all traces of these
                    effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs of the floats.

                <h1>Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
                <p>Unknown to the participants and local leaders at the time, the 2020 Carnival season (with parades
                    running from January through Mardi Gras Day on February 25) coincided with increasing spread of
                    coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States as part of a global epidemic. At the
                    time, the disease was actively being dismissed as a major public health threat by President Donald
                    Trump and his administration. As such, federal officials did not advise against the holding of
                    Mardi Gras festivities, scrutiny over large public gatherings had yet to emerge, while scrutiny over
                    international travel primarily placed an emphasis on restricting travel from China—the country from
                    which the disease originated. The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana was reported on March
                    9, two weeks after the end of Mardi Gras.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ubsequently, the state of Louisiana saw a significant impact from the pandemic, with New Orleans in
                    particular seeing a high rate of cases. Louisiana State University (LSU) associate professor Susanne
                    Straif-Bourgeoi suggested that the rapid spread may have been aided by Mardi Gras
                    festivities. Researchers of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette estimated that
                    Louisiana had the fastest growth rate of cases (67.8%, overtaking overtaking New York's 66.1%
                    growth) in the 14 days since its first reported case than any region in the world
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mayor LaToya Cantrell stated that she would have cancelled Mardi Gras festivities had she been
                    provided with sufficient warning by the federal government, and criticized the Trump administration
                    for downplaying the threat. Amid continued spread of COVID-19 across the country, in
                    early-November 2020 Cantrell stated that celebrations in 2021 would have to be "something
                    different", as Mardi Gras could not be canceled outright since it is a religious observance. A
                    sub-committee of the Mardi Gras Advisory Committee focused on COVID-19 proposed that parades still
                    be held but with strict safety protocols and recommendations, including enforcement of social
                    distancing, highly recommending the wearing of face masks by attendees, discouraging "high value"
                    throws in order to discourage crowding, as well as discouraging the consumption of alcohol, and
                    encouraging more media coverage of parades to allow at-home viewing

            <div class="subject" id="subject5">
                <h1>Traditional colors</h1>
                <p>The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold, and purple. The
                    colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their
                    inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is
                    unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially
                    selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism
                </p>
                <p>
                    Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory
                    that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and
                    Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely
                    associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus
                    avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the
                    rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other
                    colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats
                    themed around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in
                    that order symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as
                    purple, green, and gold, in that order—even though this order violates the rule of tincture.
